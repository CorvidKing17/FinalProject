<h1>The Solar System</h1>
<p> 
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The Milky Way Galaxy contains more than <i>one-hundred-thousand-million stars</i>, and equally as many planets. And while there are that many planets and stars, creating nearly 3,200 individual systems, only one has known life: <b>Our Solar System</b>
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Ever since I was a kid, I have <i>loved</i> space, and have sought out everything I could learn about it. One of the most amazing things I remember learning was how unique our solar system truly is, as its easy division into 4 parts made it an easy subject to teach, learn, and absorb, which is what I plan to do now.

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;As you explore the solar system through the pages I have designed, I hope you enjoy every part along your journey of space, and learn to love and admire it as much as I do.
