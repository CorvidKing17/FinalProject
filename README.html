<h1>The Solar System</h1>
<p> 
    The Milky Way Galaxy contains more than *one-hundred-thousand-million stars*, and equally as many planets. And while there are that many planets and stars, creating nearly 3,200 individual systems, only one has known life: **Our Solar System**
    <br>
    Ever since I was a kid, I have *loved* space, and have sought out everything I could learn about it. One of the most amazing things I remember learning was how unique our solar system truly is, as its easy division into 4 parts made it an easy subject to teach, learn, and absorb, which is what I plan to do now.
    <br>
    Explore Our Solar System!
    + __[The Sun](SUN.md)__
    + __[Terrestrial Planets](TERRESTRIAL.md)__
    + __[Planetoids & Asteroid Belts](ASTEROID.md)__
    + __[The Jovian Gas Giants](GAS.md)__
    <br>
    As you explore the solar system through the pages I have designed, I hope you enjoy every part along your journey of space, and learn to love and admire it as much as I do.
