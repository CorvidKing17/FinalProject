<h2>What Is A Terrestrial Planet?</h2>
<p>
    When we refer to terrestrial planets get their names from Latin, as terrestrial and telluric are from the Latin words for Earth, (Terra and tallus), and are used as these planets have a composition that is similar to that of the Earth.
    <br><br>
    We can easily identify the terrestrial planets because they have <b>solid and rocky surfaces</b>, being much smaller but much denser than an opposing gas giant planet. As a result of the main composition being silicate rocks and metal, the terrestrial planets have solid surfaces with several different layers in the interior, all built around a highly compressed, molten metal core.
    <br><br>
    Terrestrial rings also differ from gas giants in that they feature no rings, vastly fewer moons, secondry atmospheres (in most cases), and different magnetic fields.

<h2>The Inner Solar System</h2>
<p>
    The terrestrial planets in our solar system all exist in the inner half, being located much closer to the <a href="theSun.html" title="The Sun">Sun</a>, and being seperated from the <a href="gasGiants.html" title="The Jovian Gas Giants">Jovian Gas Giants</a> by the <a href="planetoidsAsteroids.html" title="Planetoids and Asteroids">Main Asteroid Belt</a>.
    <br><br>
    Terrestrial planets exist in the inner solar system due to their location to the sun, as they receive more intense solar radiation than their gaseous counterparts. Solar winds also blow off lighter elements from the inner plants, leaving only the remaining heavy materials.
    <br><br>
    <h3>The terrestrial planets of our inner solar system are:</h3>
    <!-- Look at linking those words to their spots on the site? -->
    <ul>
        <li>Mercury</li>
        <li>Venus</li>
        <li>Earth</li>
        <li>Mars</li>
        <li>Honorable Mention: Pluto</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Mercury</h2>
<p>
    Mercury is only a third of Earth's size and is the smallest of the planets in our solar system. As the closest neighbor of the Sun, any potential moons and atmosphere have been burned away, or lost due to Mercury's smaller gravitational field.

    <br><br>
    Astronomers believe that there is water around Mercury's north and south poles, but that planet still receives too intense solar radiation for a human to ever live there.
    <br><br>
    Mercury is the fastest-moving planet in our solar system, moving at about 47 kilometers per second (29 miles per second). It also has the shortest orbital period, as while a year on Earth takes about 365 days, a year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days long.
