<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The Sun, as many know, is a firey engine that allows life to exist on Earth. But <i>how</i> does the sun itself work?
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Our sun has no solid mass, and is made almost entirely from hydrogen and helium. These gases carry out different functions in each layer, which is measured by the percentage of the sun's toTh a combination of three complex mechanisms:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>A circular electric current that runs through the sun.</li><br>
        <li>Layers of the sun that rotate at different speeds.</li><br>
        <li>The sun's ability to conduct electricity.</li><br>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Near the sun's equator, magnetic field lines make small loops near the surface. Magnetic field lines that flow through the poles extend much farther, thousands of kilometers, before returning to the opposite pole.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun rotates around its own axis, just like Earth. The sun rotates counterclockwise, and takes between 25 and 35 days to complete a single rotation.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun orbits clockwise around the center of the Milky Way. Its orbit is between 24,000 and 26,000 light-years away from the galactic center. The sun takes about 225 million to 250 million years to orbit one time around the galactic center.

<h2>Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun's energy travels to Earth at the speed of light in the form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The electriomagnetic spectrum exists as waves of different frequencies and wavelengths.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The frequency of a wave represents how many times the wave repeats itself in a certain unit of time. Waves with very short wavelengths repeat themselves several times in a given unit of time, so they are high-frequency. In contrast, low-frequency waves have much longer wavelengths.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The vast majority of electromagnetic waves that come from the sun are invisible to us. The most high-frequency waves emitted by the sun are gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet radiation (UV rays). The most harmful UV rays are almost completely absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere. Less potent UV rays travel through the atmosphere, and can cause sunburn.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun also emits infrared radiation—whose waves are a much lower-frequency. Most heat from the sun arrives as infrared energy.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Sandwiched between infrared and UV is the visible spectrum, which contains all the colors we, as humans, can see. The color red has the longest wavelengths (closest to infrared), and violet (closest to UV) the shortest.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun itself is white, which means it contains all the colors in the visible spectrum. The sun appears orangish-yellow because the blue light it emits has a shorter wavelength, and is scattered in the atmosphere—the same process that makes the sky appear blue.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Astronomers, however, call the sun a “yellow dwarf” star because its colors fall within the yellow-green section of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<h2>Evolution Of The Sun</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun, although it has sustained all life on our planet, will not shine forever. The sun has already existed for about 4.5 billion years.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The process of nuclear fusion, which creates the heat and light that make life on our planet possible, is also the process that slowly changes the sun’s composition. Through nuclear fusion, the sun is constantly using up the hydrogen in its core:Every second, the sun fuses around 620 million metric tons of hydrogen into helium.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;At this stage in the sun’s life, its core is about 74% hydrogen. Over the next five billion years, the sun will burn through most of its hydrogen, and helium will become its major source of fuel.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Over those five billion years, the sun will go from “yellow dwarf” to “red giant.” When almost all of the hydrogen in the sun’s core has been consumed, the core will contract and heat up, increasing the amount of nuclear fusion that takes place. The outer layers of the sun will expand from this extra energy.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun will expand to about 200 times its current radius, swallowing Mercury and Venus.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Astrophysicists debate whether Earth’s orbit would expand beyond the sun’s reach, or if our planet would be engulfed by the sun as well.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;As the sun expands, it will spread its energy over a larger surface area, which has an overall cooling effect on the star. This cooling will shift the sun’s visible light to a reddish color—a red giant.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Eventually, the sun’s core reaches a temperature of about 100 million on the Kelvin scale (almost 100 million degrees Celsius or 180 million degrees Farenheit), the common scientific scale for measuring temperature. When it reaches this temperature, helium will begin fusing to create carbon, a much heavier element. This will cause intense solar wind and other solar activity, which will eventually throw off the entire outer layers of the sun. The red giant phase will be over. Only the sun’s carbon core will be left, and as a “white dwarf,” it will not create or emit energy.

<h2>Energy From The Sun</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;<b>Photosynthesis:</b> Sunlight provides necessary light and energy to plants and other producers in the food web. These producers absorb the sun’s radiation and convert it into energy through a process called photosynthesis. 
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Producers are mostly plants (on land) and algae (in aquatic regions). They are the foundation of the food web, and their energy and nutrients are passed on to every other living organism. 
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;<b>Fossil Fuels:</b> Photosynthesis is also responsible for all of the fossil fuels on Earth. Scientists estimate that about three billion years ago, the first producers evolved in aquatic settings. Sunlight allowed plant life to thrive and adapt. After the plants died, they decomposed and shifted deeper into the earth, sometimes thousands of meters. This process continued for millions of years.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Under intense pressure and high temperatures, these remains became what we know as fossil fuels. These microorganisms became petroleum, natural gas, and coal.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;People have developed processes for extracting these fossil fuels and using them for energy. However, fossil fuels are a nonrenewable resource. They take millions of years to form.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;<b>Solar Energy Technology:</b> Solar energy technology harnesses the sun’s radiation and converts it into heat, light, or electricity.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Solar energy is a renewable resource, and many technologies can harvest it directly for use in homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals. Some solar energy technologies include solar voltaic cells and panels, solar thermal collectors, solar thermal electricity, and solar architecture.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Photovoltaics use the sun’s energy to speed up electrons in solar cells and generate electricity. This form of technology has been used widely, and can provide electricity for rural areas, large power stations, buildings, and smaller devices such as parking meters and trash compactors.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;The sun’s energy can also be harnessed by a method called “concentrated solar power,” in which the sun’s rays are reflected and magnified by mirrors and lenses. The intensified ray of sunlight heats a fluid, which creates steam and powers an electric generator. 
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Solar power can also be collected and distributed without machinery or electronics. For example, roofs can be covered with vegetation or painted white to decrease the amount of heat absorbed into the building, thereby decreasing the amount of electricity needed for air conditioning. This is solar architecture.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;Sunlight is abundant: In one hour, Earth’s atmosphere receives enough sunlight to power the electricity needs of all people for a year. However, solar technology is expensive, and depends on sunny and cloudless local weather to be effective. Methods of harnessing the sun’s energy are still being developed and improved.
